Python Natural Language Understanding AI Bot
This project is a natural language understanding artificial intelligence bot developed using the Python programming language. It allows users to interact with the bot in natural language, ask questions, and the bot attempts to find close matches in its database of terms. Users also have the capability to teach the bot new terms to enhance its knowledge base.

Features
Natural Language Communication: Users can communicate with the bot using text input in natural language.
Matching and Retrieval: The bot can find close matches between user input and terms stored in its database.
Term Addition: Users can contribute to the bot's database by adding previously unknown terms.
JSON Database: The database is maintained in JSON format for easy management and scalability.
Interaction Logging: The bot can log user interactions, which can be useful for analytics and improvement.
Bidirectional Responses: Capable of providing direct responses to user queries and learning from interactions.
Usage
Requirements:

Python 3.x
difflib (for get_close_matches)
json libraries
Installation:

Clone the project to your local machine.
Create a database.json file or incorporate an existing database into the project.
Execution:
